Script is developed on the hotwire system made by Hasan. All changes to the script have been made by me.

Specifications
- You can lock or unlock your car with L key.
- You can open the doors of locked vehicles for which you do not have a key by using a lock pick.
- If a vehicle is uncovered, it can be opened from the inside of the door even if it is locked. So you don't need to use a lock pick.
- If a vehicle has an open or no door, it can be entered. So you don't need to use a lock pick.
- If you do not have the key when you enter the vehicle, you can hotwire or search the vehicle.
- The items you will find when you search the vehicle are completely random. Probabilities vary greatly depending on luck.
- When you lock the vehicle, you should be able to do it with the skill bar. At best you have to complete the skill bar three times if you are lucky, if you are unluckiest man at worst 6 times.
- A regular structure has been provided by creating Config and Locale files. You can change things from config as you want, and translate them to the language you want with locale.


## Important Note
While I was making the script, I did not oblige the name to be changed so that you can edit it, please do not change the name please!
